# Propensity_Model

Descriptive Stats, Data analysis and Model Building for the Bank Campaign Data

The model built was a in class assignment where we used our knowledge to get the basic insights in the data, and finaly used some ensemble methods to build the Machine Learning Model to predict for the new data.

Toolkits used
* Pandas library for data Handling
* Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries to plot the various plots 

Steps Followed:

Step 1: Data Reading and Data  Preprocesing

Step 2: Checking for missing values and handling those missing values 
  <br>The missing values in the model replaced using various techniques like mean, mode, median, KNN imputer etc

Step 3: Data Analysis 
  <br>The data was analysed to get most of the insights form the data, using pandas and matplotlib to visualize those.
  
Step 4: Data preparation for test and train
  <br> The coloumns required for training were selected by seeing the crelation between the features and the selected features we split into training and test set using skleaarns train test split. 
  * The data has been mpormalized so that there will not be outlies effect on the model.
  
Step 5: Data Modeling and Validation
  <br>We have used the Linear Regression to build the model.
